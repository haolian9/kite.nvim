a file picker for nvim

features:
* uses floating windows
* the floatwin respects cursor position and sets proper width
* intuitive yet opinionated keymaps
* employs only one buffer

non-goals:
* sidebar
* filesystem modifications
* git integrations
* icons

thanks:
* vim-dirvish which inspired me to roll my own one.
